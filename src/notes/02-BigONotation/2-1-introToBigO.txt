Big O helps us in analzing the performance of an algorithm.

It helps us understand time and space complexity.

Big O allows us to formally talk about how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the input grows.

The relationship between the input size and then the time relative to that input.

We say that an algorithm is O(f(n)) if the number of simple operations the computer has to do is eventually less than a constant times f(n) as n increases.
