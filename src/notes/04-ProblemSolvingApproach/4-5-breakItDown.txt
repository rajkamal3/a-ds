Explicitly write out the steps you need to take.

Example:
// A function which takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string.

function charCount(str) {
    /*
    // make object to return at end

    // loop over string, for each character
        // if the char is a number/letter AND is a key in object, add one to count
        // if the char is a number/letter AND not in object, add one it to object and set value to 1
        // if character is something else (space, period, etc.) don't do anything

    // return object at end
    */
}
